    "- Implement and benchmark Buffer of Thought (BoT) agent on navigation tasks\n",
    "- Compare memory-based reasoning against reactive and planning strategies\n",
    "- Evaluate performance metrics: success rate, steps to completion, inference time, token usage\n",

    "BoT is a memory-augmented reasoning framework where the agent maintains a buffer of past observations, actions, and reasoning traces. This allows the LLM to:\n",
    "- Build cumulative understanding across multiple steps\n",
    "- Reference past decisions to inform current choices\n",
    "- Adapt strategies based on historical success/failure patterns"
